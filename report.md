# The project is not finished yet!

- All the functionality asked for in the project description is implemented. The reason I say it is not finished is because of some unusual decisions I had to make in order to finish this within the tight time window.

The code needs cleanup. I wanted to use clean architecture, but I found myself short on time, so I abandoned it.

The time constraint really affected things. I actually made sure that I didn't spend one minute more than 6 hours on this project.

I would have finished it fully if it wasn't for the sanctions on Iran. I spent at least 2 hours trying to find a way to make requests to Firebase, but it all resulted in 403 errors. The only way I managed to run the code and debug it was by actually deploying it.

Anyway, if you start reading the code, you might see some strange and "unoptimized" code. I promise you, I know every best practice, but I couldn't apply them due to time constraints.
