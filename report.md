# The project is not finished yet!

- All the functionality asked for in the project description is implemented. The reason I say it is not finished is because of some weird moves I had to make in order to finish this in this tight time window.

The code needs cleanup. I wanted to do clean architecture but I found myself in time trouble so I abandoned it.

The time really messed things up, to be honest. I actually made sure that I didn't spend one minute after 6 hours on this project.

I would finish it fully if it wasn't for the sanctions on Iran. I spent at least 2 hours trying to find a way to make requests to Firebase but it all resulted in 403. The only way I managed to run the code and debug it was by actually deploying it.

Anyway, if you start reading the code you might see some strange and "unoptimized" code. I promise you, I know every best practice but I couldn't do them due to time trouble.
